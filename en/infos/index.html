        <p class=" w-section">We are an association of young, committed people from the Hildesheim, Hanover and Magdeburg area. Many of our 38 members create art and music themselves. In the search for suitable spaces for our work, we took on the organization, design and implementation of a stage at the "Glacis Open Air" festival in Magdeburg in 2023. We were also particularly keen to take part in the BurningStone festival in Jerichower Land. A festival in a cozy setting with friends and for friends simply creates a wonderful bond among the participants.</p>

        <li><span class="font-medium">Pavilions are not welcome</span> as they usually end up as garbage and there are plenty of opportunities to chill out and socialize on the grounds.</li>
        <li><span class="font-medium">Open fires are prohibited</span> and will result in immediate exclusion from the event.</li>

    <h2 class="my-4 font-semibold text-4xl text-center">Inclusion & Terrain</h2>
    <p class="w-section">One of our most important values is to enable the participation of all people. On the one hand, we try not to exclude financially disadvantaged people by offering affordable and individualized tickets; on the other hand, we also want to include people with special needs through various measures and thus put a smile on everyone's face.<br>
        We have therefore taken the following measures to act as inclusively as possible:</p>
    <ul class="w-section list-disc p-6">
        <li>Persons with a disabled person's pass may of course bring a carer free of charge. Please bring your proof of disability with you to admission.</li>
        <li>The driveway is paved.</li>
        <li>The castle park and the access road to the grounds are flat and contain only slight inclines. The stairs of Dornburg Castle are an exception. Here, two ramps with a slight incline will pave the way into the castle.</li>
        <li>In the castle itself, festival exhibitions and stages can be found in the cellar, on the first floor and on the second floor. There will also be a stage in the outdoor area. This stage and the stage on the first floor are accessible at ground level.</li>
        <li>The remaining areas of the site consist of flat mown grass.</li>
        <li>Access to a barrier-free toilet is available throughout.</li>
        <li>There are several staff members on the festival site, as well as the awareness team, who are always ready to help you.</li>
        <li>If you have any further questions, please contact us at the following e-mail address: inklusion@cosy-festival.de.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="w-section">For us, inclusion does not just mean the inclusion of people with disabilities. For us, inclusion also means that there is no elbowing society. Everyone is equal! Elbows down! We celebrate togetherness.

        Everyone here is helpful, peaceful and, above all, tolerant. This means that it doesn't matter what nationality, faith or social background you belong to and it also doesn't matter what sexual orientation or gender you feel you belong to. We want to create a parallel world in which we can all come together happily and contentedly. Escape everyday life for a weekend and spread this spirit

        out into the world after the festival. The motto is: be and let be. Self-respect and respectful interaction with others is essential.</p>

    <h2 class="my-4 font-semibold text-4xl text-center">Awareness & Care</h2>
    <p class="w-section">Oropax are available free of charge at the bar and at the entrance.<br>
        In recent years, awareness of the existence of border crossings and discrimination has increased considerably.
        As organizers, we are prepared to take responsibility for what happens during our event. Our primary goal is to make every guest feel welcome and comfortable, regardless of their age, gender, origin or sexuality. To this end, we will cooperate in all areas as and with a specially trained awareness team, which will emphasize our shared values of cosmopolitanism, diversity and tolerance to ensure a common mindset among all. During the festival, they will be recognizable to all participants by purple high-visibility vests and a fanny pack wrapped in a string of lights. They will be present at the stages as well as at the bar.

    <h2 class="my-4 font-semibold text-4xl text-center">CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
    <p class="w-section">Organizing events outdoors while protecting the climate and the environment - this is what the signatories of the Code of Conduct for sustainable festival culture are committed to. The outdoor version of the Code of Conduct "Zukunft Feiern!" was developed by the Clubtopia initiative together with event organizers from the festival and open-air scene. With the sustainability code, event organizers commit to specific climate and environmental protection goals, such as conserving resources and nature, saving water and addressing social aspects. The goals of the Code of Conduct are binding - however, this does not mean that they have to be fulfilled from the outset, but that festivals and open airs must set out to achieve them. In order to achieve the goals, the signatories can select from a detailed pool of measures those suggestions that can best be implemented at their event and location. The Code of Conduct for a sustainable festival culture is a further development of the Code of Conduct for a sustainable club culture "Zukunft Feiern!" by Clubtopia, a project by clubliebe e.V. and BUND Berlin. The sustainability code was developed as part of the round tables for a green club culture and published in September 2021.
